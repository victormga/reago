## ReaGO
ReaGO is a Go library for building truly native, reactive GUIs. Unlike other solutions, it does not rely on WebViews or workaroundsâ€”everything is rendered natively.
This is currently under development and a lot of things might change. It's not production ready.

#
---
#### XML-Based Syntax
ReaGO uses an XML-based syntax to define UI templates, making it intuitive and familiar for developers experienced with HTML. Many standard HTML-like tags are supported, and in most cases, they behave similarly.
``` go
func main() {
	dom := reago.NewDOM()

	dom.Template(`
		<padding all="15">
			<row>
				<col>
					<label>This will be displayed on the left.</label>
					<label>This will be displayed below /\.</label>
				</col>
				<col>
					<label>This will be displayed on the right.</label>
					<label>This will be displayed below /\.</label>
				</col>
			</row>
		</padding>
	`)

	window := reago.NewWindow("My App", 720, 480)
	window.Show(dom)
}
```

#

#### Reactive Data Binding
You can sync the data between GO and the UI by using `UseState`.
``` go
func main() {
	dom := reago.NewDOM()

	clock := dom.UseState().String("clock", "...")
	go func() {
		for {
			clock.Set(time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123Z))
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
		}
	}()

	dom.Template(`
		<center>
			<text size="20" bind:content="clock"></text>
		</center>
	`)

	window := reago.NewWindow("My App", 400, 600)
	window.Show(dom)
}
```

#
---
#### Two-Way Binding
Two-way binding is supported. You can bind data between GO and the UI by using `UseState`.
``` go
func main() {
	dom := reago.NewDOM()

	username := dom.UseState().String("username", "")
	username.OnChange(func(value string) {
		println("The username was changed to:", value)
	})

	dom.Template(`
		<center>
			<label>Username</label>
			<input type="text" bind:value="username" />
		</center>
	`)

	window := reago.NewWindow("My App", 400, 600)
	window.Show(dom)
}
```

#
---
#### Callbacks
You can also assign callbacks for events.
``` go
func main() {
	dom := reago.NewDOM()
	
	dom.UseCallback("clicked", func() {
		println("Button clicked!")
	})
	
	dom.Template(`
		<padding all="15">
			<col>
				<label>Click the button below</label>
				<button bind:click="clicked">Click me!</button>
			</col>
		</padding>
	`)

	window := reago.NewWindow("My App", 400, 600)
	window.Show(dom)
}
```

#
#
#
---
#### Loading From Files
You can also load the XML string from a file instead of passing the string.
```

```

#
#
#
---
#### Watching For Changes
This will rerender the window every time the xml file changes (works on dev).
```

```

#
#
#
---
#### Requirements
- GO 1.24 (Older versions might be supported, but no test was done).
- ReaGO uses `fyne v2` under the hood for renderization, so the `fyne v2` environment prerequisites are required for it to work. You can prepare your environment by following the instructions in `https://docs.fyne.io/started/`.
